As of 7 December 2015 this directory provides composer-compatibility and pretty autoloading namespaces but *does not* directly provide implementations. Implementations are all in the ``ugly/`` subdirectory in the root of the repository. This is done to provide compatibility and ease-of-use with pre-namespace versions of PHP.

As we have removed official support for PHP < 5.3, this feature may disappear as soon as there is a good reason to.
